we make use of git bash in order to communicate with our fules

first we have user touch index.html in order to create a file called index,html in the directory
again we have used touch app.js to again createa a new file called app.js
then  we need to initialize a local repo by git init. but keep in mind that, we cant see the created file
you can go to view, foilder, and uchaecked hidden files
